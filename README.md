# MachineLearning

Different Problem Statements and their solution with explanation.

Housing Value Prediction: This project is based on the famous "California Housing Data-set". The project involved preprocessing on the
data, creating pipeline for various algorithms and then applying various algorithms compare the results of all the algorithms and their weaknesses. 

We have applied algorithms on the data-set, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forrest and Gradient Boosting.

Gradient Boosting outperformed every other algorithm we used.
