# Housing Value Prediction: 
This project is based on the famous "California Housing Data-set". The project involved preprocessing on the
data, using pipeline for various algorithms and then performing a acomparative study of different algorithms.

We have applied algorithms on the data-set, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forrest and Gradient Boosting.

Gradient Boosting outperformed every other algorithm we used.
